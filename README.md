## ML Crypto Predictor

</div>

This repository contains a machine-learning program that can be trained to predict the prices of Bitcoin-USD (Or any other cryptocurrency) accurately.
It trains off of around 900 datasets from the past thousand days.

# DISCLAIMER
This is still a heavy work in progress, and is not 100% accurate by any means. This can be seen when you compare past vs predicted future values in a table.
This was made by a GCSE computer science student, so let's not bash the coding skills :)

## Installation

The easiest way to install this program is just to clone the repository to your computer and run "main.py". Depending on computer hardware it will take anywhere between 10-30 minutes to train, then will output the results for you to do what you please with.
